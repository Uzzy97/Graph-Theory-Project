# Graph Theory

It is a program in the Python programming language that can build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression, and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text.

## Thompson's Construction

* Algorithm made by ken thompson in 1960â€™s.
* Convert regular expressions into a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton.
* This is one way to convert a regular expression into an NFA.
* Thompson's Construction is a simple and systematic method. It guarantees that the resulting NFA will have exactly one final state and one start state.
* Thompson's Construction works on fragments of NFA.
* Make bigger NFA from smaller ones.
* Normal characters push fragments to the stack.
* Special characters pop from and push to the stack.
